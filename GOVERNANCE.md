# Governance

## Admin structure

- Organization admins are listed in GitHub org membership.
- Minimum operational target is 2 active admins.

## Decision process

- Canonical policy: `docs/governance/roles-and-voting.md`.
- Standard decisions: simple majority vote of active admins.
- Quorum: at least 2 admins participate.
- Ties: decision deferred until an additional admin vote is recorded.

## Financial controls

- Canonical policy: `docs/governance/fund-approval.md`.
- Any fund movement or budget approval requires 2-admin signoff documented in a public issue or decision log entry.
- Public ledger records are treated as canonical financial references.

## Transparency

- Governance decisions are recorded in `docs/decision-log.md`.
- Reporting cadence is defined in `docs/transparency/reporting-cadence.md`.
- Report templates live in `docs/transparency/`.

## Moderation and appeals

- Draft policy: `docs/policies/moderation-and-appeals.md`.

## Future governance expansion

- Current admin-led model is a bootstrap phase.
- Broader community voting and representation process will be proposed via RFCs in this repository.
