# Governance

## Admin structure

- Organization admins are listed in GitHub org membership.
- Minimum operational target is 2 active admins.

## Decision process

- Standard decisions: simple majority vote of active admins.
- Ties: decision deferred until an additional admin vote is recorded.

## Financial controls

- Any fund movement or budget approval requires 2-admin signoff documented in a public issue or decision log entry.
- Open Collective ledger will be treated as the canonical public financial record.

## Transparency

- Governance decisions are recorded in `docs/decision-log.md`.
- Periodic public updates follow `docs/transparency-report-template.md`.

## Future governance expansion

- Current admin-led model is a bootstrap phase.
- Broader community voting and representation process will be proposed via RFCs in this repository.
