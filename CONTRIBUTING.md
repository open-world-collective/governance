## How to propose governance changes

1. Open a `Policy proposal` issue using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/policy_proposal.yml`.
2. Link any relevant prior decisions from `docs/decision-log.md`.
3. For significant policy changes, open an RFC-style issue and allow at least 7 days for comment.

## Meeting notes

- Record governance calls or async meetings using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meeting_note.yml`.
- Include attendees, decisions, and action items with owners.

## Decision recording

Accepted changes must include:

- final decision text
- date
- approvers
- follow-up actions

Then append to `docs/decision-log.md`.
