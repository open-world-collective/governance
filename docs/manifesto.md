# Manifesto: what if we meant it

This is Open World Collective’s “reason for being”, mirrored from the project homepage (Feb 2026) so it can be cited and versioned alongside governance documents.

virtual worlds keep promising shared<br />
space.

but most of them still run like<br />
private kingdoms.

you can build there.<br />
you can gather there.<br />
you can make a living there.

until you can’t.

[a long time ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20131028083253/http://www.qarl.com/qLab/?p=89)<br />
i wrote that we cannot accept<br />
"trust us."

no matter how cute and earnest<br />
our rulers appear in the<br />
beginning—

we need democracy in the<br />
foundation.<br />
we need it in writing.

shared space without shared<br />
power is tenancy.

so what if we took that<br />
seriously now?

what if we built a virtual world<br />
where democratic rights are part<br />
of the protocol, not just a line<br />
in a terms-of-service page:

due process before exile.<br />
transparent rule changes.<br />
meaningful appeals.<br />
portable identity.<br />
portable assets.<br />
ip ownership for honest<br />
creators, not the tax man.

rights that survive acquisition.<br />
rights that survive new<br />
management.<br />
rights that survive the mood of<br />
a moderator.

if "shared virtual space" is the<br />
goal, then shared power has to<br />
be part of the design.

what would that look like?
