# Charter (Draft)

## Reason for being

Open World Collective exists to build shared virtual space where shared power is part of the design. See `docs/manifesto.md` for the canonical statement of intent.

## Mission

Build and steward open infrastructure for a community-governed virtual world where democratic rights are part of the protocol—starting with vanilla-compatible systems and evolving toward an engine-agnostic stack over time.

## Principles

- Democratic rights in the foundation (due process, transparent rule changes, meaningful appeals)
- Portability (identity and assets)
- Creator ownership and respect (IP stays with creators)
- Transparency-first governance
- Public accountability for funding decisions
- Practical, iterative delivery
- Clear separation of governance policy and technical execution

## Scope

- Governance policy and process
- Financial control and transparency practices
- Community participation model (bootstrap phase -> expanded phase)
- Rights, due process, and appeals (as implementable protocol + policy)

## Non-goals (current phase)

- Claiming legal-foundation status
- Overpromising final governance mechanics before implementation experience
