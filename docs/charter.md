- Public accountability for funding decisions
- Practical, iterative delivery
- Clear separation of governance policy and technical execution

## Scope

- Governance policy and process
- Financial control and transparency practices
- Community participation model (bootstrap phase -> expanded phase)

## Non-goals (current phase)

- Overpromising final governance mechanics before implementation experience
