# Governance Roadmap Phases

## Phase 1: Governance and transparency baseline

- Define roles, voting, and fund approval rules.
- Establish decision log and monthly reporting cadence.
- Publish moderation and appeals draft.

## Phase 2: Server policy baseline

- Define server operations policy for Paper runtime deployment.
- Document security expectations and incident process.
- Clarify plugin review and release policy.

## Phase 3: Broader participation

- Define representation model beyond admin-only voting.
- Introduce contributor councils or delegated working groups.
- Pilot community voting for scoped policy domains.

## Phase 4: Engine-agnostic transition planning

- Keep governance applicable beyond game-specific tooling.
- Define compatibility principles for future client/server stacks.
