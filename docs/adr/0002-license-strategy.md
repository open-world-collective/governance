# ADR 0002: Governance Repository License Strategy

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28

## Context

Governance artifacts should remain openly reusable with the same downstream freedoms.

## Decision

Use a copyleft license for this repository and keep governance documents in a public repo with versioned history.

## Consequences

- Governance process remains transparent and forkable.
- Downstream projects can adapt policies while preserving openness.
- Future repos may choose different licenses based on technical context.
