# ADR 0001: Initial Governance Model

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28

## Context

The project needs a lightweight but auditable governance model for early-stage execution.

## Decision

Adopt an admin-led bootstrap model with:

- simple majority voting for standard decisions
- quorum of at least 2 admins
- explicit recusal on conflicts
- required decision log entries for accepted decisions

## Consequences

- Enables fast decisions while preserving accountability.
- Keeps process understandable for new contributors.
- Requires later iteration toward broader representation.
