# Rights Baseline (Draft v1)

This document translates the project manifesto (`docs/manifesto.md`) into concrete governance commitments and implementation targets.

This is a governance policy draft and is not legal advice.

## Scope

Applies to Open World Collective-operated project spaces (e.g., official servers, community channels, and org-managed infrastructure) and to the governance rules in this repository.

## Baseline rights

### Due process before exile

- “Exile” includes permanent bans/removals from official project spaces and revocation of project participation rights.
- Default posture: no permanent exile without a recorded action rationale and an appeal path.
- Emergency safety actions (temporary) may be taken immediately, but must be documented promptly with rationale and duration.
- Canonical process draft: `docs/policies/moderation-and-appeals.md`.

### Transparent rule changes

- Policy and rule changes happen in public, via issues and PRs in this repository.
- Changes must be linkable, reviewable, and time-stamped (issue + PR + decision log entry when adopted).
- Canonical process draft: `docs/governance/policy-change-process.md`.

### Meaningful appeals

- Appeals must be possible for significant moderation actions.
- Reviews should be performed by at least two admins who were not directly involved in the original action.
- When full details cannot be public for safety/privacy, publish a redacted summary and rationale.
- Canonical process draft: `docs/policies/moderation-and-appeals.md`.

### Portable identity

- Identity should not be designed as a trap: participants should be able to export their identity data from official systems in a documented format.
- If portability is not yet implemented for a given system, the limitation and planned path must be documented.

### Portable assets

- Participants should be able to export assets they have rights to (their own creations and any explicitly portable assets) in documented formats where technically feasible.
- If portability is constrained by platform or security realities, document the constraint and the mitigation plan.

### Creator ownership and respect

- Default posture: creators retain IP ownership of their work.
- Any licenses required for contribution, distribution, or operation must be explicit, written down, and narrowly scoped to the project’s needs (no “trust us” capture clauses).

## Evidence and recordkeeping

The project should be able to point to a public paper trail that these rights are real:

- Policy changes: linked issues/PRs and (when adopted) `docs/decision-log.md` entries.
- Moderation actions: action records + appeal outcomes per `docs/policies/moderation-and-appeals.md`.
- Transparency: monthly reports per `docs/transparency/reporting-cadence.md` and templates under `docs/transparency/`.

## Review cadence

Revisit this baseline at least quarterly (or after any major incident) and propose amendments via the standard policy change process.
